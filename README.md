# Welcome

This is a small package used to test building PDFs with Prawn.

## Requirements

* [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
* [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
* [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)

Run `./install.sh` to install the packages you need. After that run `./run.sh` to run the app.

If you are on Windows, that sucks, figure it out (or add powershell scripts to do these steps, plz)

## Prawn

Prawn is used to make PDFs. That's nice. [Here is the Prawn manual](http://prawnpdf.org/manual.pdf).

Woo hoo.
